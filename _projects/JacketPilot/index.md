title: Jacket Assistance System (ReLab HackaHealth)  
description: As part of the Assistive Technology Challenge 2025 at ReLab ETH Zürich, our team developed a jacket assistance chair for a Challenger with upper-body mobility impairments. The system uses a motorized backrest and foot pedal interface to allow users to independently put on a jacket, eliminating the need for caregiver support. I was the Technical Lead on this project, responsible for the mechanical design and prototyping using Siemens NX, 3D printing, and hands-on iteration.

## What?
Developed a **motorized jacket assistance chair** that enables users with limited upper-body mobility to put on a jacket independently.

**The goal:** Restore autonomy in daily dressing routines using simple, reliable mechanics and intuitive user interaction.

## How?
The user hangs their jacket on the chair’s backrest and sits down, sliding their arms into the sleeves.  
Using a **foot pedal**, they activate a **motorized backrest** that lifts the jacket smoothly up their back.  
Once the jacket is in place, the user stands up and walks forward — and the jacket is on.

We used **Siemens NX** to design and simulate the structure, followed by **3D printing** and **laser cutting** for quick iteration and prototyping.  
Focus areas included **ergonomics**, **mechanical safety**, and **ease of use**.
 
## Results
Created a **fully working prototype** used by our Challenger in real-life scenarios.  
Demonstrated reliable function, intuitive control, and positive user feedback on autonomy and dignity.  
Showcased how accessible engineering can meaningfully improve daily life for individuals with physical impairments.
