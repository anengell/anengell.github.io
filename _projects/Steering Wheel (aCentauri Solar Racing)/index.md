title: Solar Car Steering Wheel
description: As a member of ETH Zürich’s aCentauri Solar Racing team, I independently designed and built a custom steering wheel for our solar race car, which competed in the 3,000 km Bridgestone World Solar Challenge across Australia. The steering wheel was engineered to be lightweight, crash-safe, and ergonomic, fully integrated with the car’s unique control system. Using Siemens NX and FEM analysis, I optimized the design for strength and performance. I fabricated and iterated the part using 3D printing, ensuring it met both technical and driver comfort requirements. I also served as one of the four main drivers, using the steering wheel in real race conditions — giving me direct feedback on its performance and usability.
skills:
  - Siemens NX (CAD + FEM)
  - 3D Printing
  - Laser Cutting
  - Rapid Prototyping
