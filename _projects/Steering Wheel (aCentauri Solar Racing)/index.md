Designed and built a custom steering wheel for a solar race car in the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge (3,000 km across Australia). The goal: lightweight, crash-safe, ergonomic, and fully integrated with the vehicle's unique control system.

- Used Siemens NX for FEM optimization
- Applied ergonomic principles for long-duration comfort
- Leveraged 3D printing for fast iteration
- Integrated with TeamCenter and raced the car as pilot
